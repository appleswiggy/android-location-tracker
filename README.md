# android-location-tracker
Track your friend's location or share your own.

# Summary
I have created three activities in android studio, the first one is the main launcher activity (`MainActivity.java`) in which the user can select whether to share his location or to track his friend’s location by inputting his coordinates. The second activity (`MapsActivity.java`) loads when the user decides to track someone’s location in the main activity. The third activity (`ShareActivity.java`) loads when the user decides to share his/her location. This activity asks for the user's location permission before displaying his coordinates. There's also a button to copy the user's coordinates to the clipboard if he decides to share it with his friends.
